## Projects

### Data Science Projects

**Project 1: Banking Marketing Targets**

  - Description: The project focuses on analyzing customer profiles and predicting their likelihood to subscribe to term deposits at UNO Bank following a marketing campaign.
  - Tools & Technologies: The team utilized various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost for modeling. The outcome was evaluated using metrics like AUC-Score, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, and Accuracy. XGBoost emerged as the final model due to its balanced performance across these metrics.
  - Key Findings or Results: Key findings include the identification of significant predictors for subscription likelihood, such as customer contact duration and previous campaign outcomes, ultimately aiming to increase term deposit subscriptions to 15% as per the management's request.
